/********************************************************************************************
* This is the main entry point for the game.
* The game is a fun shooting game with gesture control, wrapped as a ROS package.
* You gain points as you shoot (RIGHT CLICK) at the falling debris and lose health as you collide with them.
* You can move the player either by using the keyboard (WASD) or by using hand movement.
* Make a fist to move the player and open your hand to stop the player.
* The game ends when you lose all your health.
